SELECT DISTINCT CITY

WHERE CITY REGEXP '^[aeiouAEIOU].*[aeiouAEIOU]$';

REGEX breakdown :
^             - beginning of the line
[aeiouAEIOU]  - one character in the start is a vowel
.             - A wildcard character that matches any single character except for newline characters.
                It can represent letters, digits, whitespace, punctuation, or any other character.
*             - a quantifier that specifies that the preceding character can appear zero or more times.
Therefore,
.*            - Matches any sequence of characters, including empty strings
[aeiouAEIOU]  - one character is a vowel BEFORE END OF LINE
$             - END OF LINE
