SELECT DISTINCT(city)
FROM station
WHERE id % 2 = 0
ORDER BY city ASC;

  1.SQL uses = for equality comparison, not ==.

  2.In SQL, when using the DISTINCT keyword, you can write it with or without parentheses around the column name(s) or expression(s) you want to be distinct.
    The reason is that SQL is generally lenient when it comes to whitespace and formatting.
    In SQL, whitespace (spaces, tabs, line breaks) is usually ignored, except when it's needed to separate keywords, identifiers, or literals.
