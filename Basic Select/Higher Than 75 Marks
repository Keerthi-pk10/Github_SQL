order by substring(name,length(name)-2,3), id

SUBSTRING(name, LENGTH(name) - 2, 3): This extracts a substring from the name column, 
                                      starting from the third-to-last character (LENGTH(name) - 2) 
                                      and extending for three characters (3).
This effectively captures the last three characters of each name.
