## In most SQL databases, string literals should be enclosed in single quotes (' '), not double quotes " "

## Case sensitivity :

1. SQL keywords (e.g., SELECT, FROM, WHERE) are generally not case sensitive.
2. The case sensitivity of table and column names depends on the settings of the database server 
    (e.g., PostgreSQL: Case-sensitive by default, MySQL: Case-insensitive by default).
3. String comparison may be case sensitive or case insensitive depending on the collation settings of the database or individual columns.
   Collation is a set of rules that determines how data is sorted and compared in a database.
   It defines the character set encoding, case sensitivity, accent sensitivity, and other locale-specific considerations for text data.
